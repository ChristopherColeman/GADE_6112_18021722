Task 1

Made a couple of changes to the code to reduce the number of errors found within. There are now now scripting errors that I can see aside from line 174 and 176 in the meleeUnit. 
The compiler comes up with an error stating that "Argument 1 must be passed using the ref keyword" I know that this is to do with changing the value of the local variable but am still not sure how to fix it. 
Within the rangedUnit this does not error.
